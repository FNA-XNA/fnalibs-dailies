These are the daily builds for the FNA native libraries.

This repository automatically creates archives containing all of the native libs that can be used by FNA. For more information about these libs, visit the [FNA documentation](https://fna-xna.github.io/docs/1%3A-Setting-Up-FNA/#step-2-download-native-libraries). 

Note that this archive always targets the latest development version of FNA - compatibility with stable releases is not guaranteed. 

To download the latest fnalibs, go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/fnalibs-dailies/actions) and select the latest "CI" build. At the bottom of the page will be two "artifacts", named fnalibs and fnalibs-apple. Those links are the zip files you want!
